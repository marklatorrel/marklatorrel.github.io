<p>Here are a few reasons why Machu Picchu is great.</p>

<ol>
    <li>You feel an outworldly energy were you are there, like if your chakras are recharging.</li>
    <li>It's made by the Inca culture, the biggest originary culture in South America before the Spanish colonization.</li>
    <li>It's really safe, and the nearest city, Cuzco, is full of history.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you come to Peru you can count on me for.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Making you a tour in Lima.</li>
    <li>You can stay in my house.</li>
    <li>Giving you advice on which places to stay in Cuzco.</li>
