                       <h6>Hey there!</h3>
                        <p class="mb-30">Born in 1995, I'm passionate about engineering & design. I have a BSc. in Mechatronic Engineering from the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, Peru’s first ranked university. I obtained first place in the courses of Philosophy, Introduction to Machine Design, Mechatronic Design Metodology and ‘Programming and Implementation of Equipment for Mechatronic Applications’.</p>
                        <p class="mb-30">During my university's last year, some close friends and I created a company called Uniclov. This company’s goal was to create a handheld device that could mimic telekinesis, so you can control your surroundings just with hand gestures. As a byproduct of the company we created a programmable coffee machine on which I designed the PCB and some parts of the machine. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Uniclov/" style="color: #e94747"> (See link)</a> </p>
                        <p class="mb-30">Life got me into international business when I was trying to reach out Chinese factories that could produce a batch of our coffee machine. In 2018 studied in the Peruvian Exporters Association (ADEX) a course on how to import goods from China due to a previously failed attempt to import some electronics by my own.</p>
                        <p class="mb-30">We produced and imported the coffee machines but sales didn’t go as expected. In a joint decision my partners and me had to close Uniclov but in parallel in March, 2019 I founded a trading company with the one thing I believed I knew how to do well, importing goods. (See the peak of Mount Stupid from the Dunning-Kruger effect)</p>
                        <p class="mb-30">This trading company is called DeChinaAPeru.com, it literally means “FromChinaToPeru” in Spanish. I provided the service of importing goods for everyone. If you are an entrepreneur in Peru and wanted any machine, I sourced the factory, coordinated the production, made the payments, managed shipping and customs clearance, everything. </p>
                        <p class="mb-30"><strong>I traded my time and knowledge in exchange for money.</strong> Those two were the only thing available for me to trade.</p>
                        <p class="mb-30">Business was doing ok, we grew from me to six workers, until December 2019 arrived. China entered a never seen before lockdown due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Chinese factories closed and if there was no China to buy from, there was no way for us to gain revenues. There was literally no FromChinaToPeru if China was closed. Months passed by without sales trying to reestructure ourselves and on March 14th 2020, the day we had our company’s first anniversary I had to let my workers go. </p>
                        <p class="mb-30">Days passed by and my country, Peru went on lockdown. My webpage www.dechinaaperu.com was still up and suddenly I was receiving calls from people that wanted Chinese products to sell for the pandemic. As a miracle, China was reopening again, their lockdown measures were successful.</p>
                        <p class="mb-30">Long story short, I had to call each member of my team to be back to work. We navigate the pandemic era together with our ups and downs. I fell from the first peak of the Dunning-Kruger effect into the Valley of Despair. We commited rookie mistakes, but solved them along the way as best as we could. We slowly scaled up into the Slope of Enlightenment. From selling almost nothing from January to March 2020, we grew into a company that sold more than 1 million USD in 2020, of which I remain the CEO.</p>
                        <p class="mb-30">Yet importing goods isn’t an exciting reason to wake up everyday, so what can be done with the knowledge we collected all these years about foreign trade to make it purposeful? </p>
                        <p class="mb-30"><strong>Well, making it accesible for everyone.</strong></p>
                        <p class="mb-30">We have seen in this learning path many people, clients and entrepreneurs that fail miserably in their first importation. If only there would be a way to prevent any person that wants to import to make mistakes, so their venture is successful and they can start their business, it would be something worth it. </p>
                        <p class="mb-30">That’s when mechatronics comes in. <strong>Everything can be automated, not only physical things but complex business processes also.</strong></p>
                        <p class="mb-30">My current goal is to make foreign trade available for everyone by creating a platform that brings together all the actors who participate in the process, let it be importation or exportation, and make the process fluid and intuitive among them. Imagine a webpage that tells you step by step what you have to do in order to bring a product from another country to yours, minimizing the risk in every corner.</p>
                        <p class="mb-30">That’s the reason I’m learning Full Stack Web Development at MITxPro. So I can understand what I need to make the webpage and how to manage developers. I apologize for my rookie projects in the portfolio, promise I’ll get better with time.</p>
                        <p class="mb-30">Thank you for having the patience to come all this way. I’ll leave my contact number and feel free to reach whenever you need a hand.</p>
                        <p class="mb-30"><strong>Markyño D. La Torre</strong></p>
